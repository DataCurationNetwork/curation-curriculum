# Example Dataset for Workshop Discussion

We conclude each section of the workshop by illustrating key points
using this data set. Note that **<span class="mark">this is not an
authentic dataset!</span>** While it is based on an actual Data Curation
Network submission (doi:
[<u>10.13020/s40h-fv72</u>](https://doi.org/10.13020/s40h-fv72)), it has
been altered for instructional purposes. Author information has been
redacted to avoid confusing it with the original.

#### Discussion Highlights

Introduction

- *Quick Overview of the README:* The submission includes data and
  > analysis code from study of wolf habitat preference.

Computing Platforms

- Operating system and hardware requirements aren’t included in the
  > README. It would be good to include CPU and memory requirements
  > since the code is computational intensive.

- There is an absolute path on line 48.

- This would be an example of non-deterministic code– fortunately, the
  > random seed is set (line 81).

Programming Languages

- The script should use an appropriate file extension for the
  > programming language (R).

Dependencies

- README indicates a now-obsolete version of R, which may make it harder
  > to run the code.

- No version information for dependencies.

- How this would work using Renv.

Documentation

- README should include a basic description of what the code does, along
  > with expected outputs.
