**Description**

This research software is a Python-based digital humanities project
designed to analyze and extract insights from large collections of
literary texts. The project utilizes natural language processing
techniques to perform various text analysis tasks such as sentiment
analysis, topic modeling, and named entity recognition. By applying
these techniques, the project seeks to uncover themes and relationships
within the texts, enabling researchers to gain deeper insights into the
literary works. All texts are written by women who were unable to secure
publishing deals in 19th century America.
