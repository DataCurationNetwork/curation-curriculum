**Summary of the DCN Specialized Data Curation Training Materials** 

**Overview:** This repo contains the curriculum materials generated as part of the Data Curation Network Institute of Museum and Library Science (IMLS) grant “Developing Specialized Data Curation Training to Address Needed Expertise in Focused Areas.” The repository contains curriculum materials for four data types:

- Code
- Geospatial data
- Scientific images
- Simulations

**Content:** Each data type has its own folder containing the following materials:

- A Lesson Plan
- Slide Deck(s) - both as PDF and a link to a Google Slide version with accompanying speaker notes
- Associated Materials, which may include exercise materials, glossaries, examples, and templates

**Methods**: Creators of this content were selected through an application process to create the curriculum for the DCN Education IMLS 2022-2024 grant. Mentors within the Project Design Team helped to guide the development of the curriculum. Creators met at a kickoff meeting to hear the scope of the project and engage with other specialized areas. In this meeting a planning document was constructed. The team began creating content, and went through an initial peer review which guided further development. Creators presented an abbreviated curriculum at a pilot workshop at Duke University on October 17-18, 2023 of the grant team, other specialized areas and accepted applicants who wished to take the workshop. Feedback was provided to the creators from which they further refined the material.

**Source Materials:** Some content was informed by the DCN CURATE(D) Steps and Workshop Curriculum developed with funding from the Institute of Museum and Library Studies (IMLS) grant  #RE-85-18-0040-18, led by PIs Cynthia Hudson Vitale, Hannah Hadley, and Briana Ezray Wham.

We also want to note that many hands went into the production of the CURATE(D) steps and the education materials that may not be named. 

Curriculum also uses real or augmented datasets in exercises, data citations for each dataset used is available for each content type. 

**Citation and Reuse:** The materials are available for reuse by the broader community under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license (CC-BY). Each data type has a unique citation that should be used when reusing those materials including a DOI pointing the archived copy of the materials (see below). 

**Archived Copies and Ongoing Development:** PDF copies of most files that were part of the IMLS funded project are also available and archived with the University of Minnesota Digital Conservancy Data Curation Network Collection [[link](https://hdl.handle.net/11299/265761)]. The GitHub files are the dynamic versions of the curriculum that might be updated and revised as the curriculum is iterated upon.
