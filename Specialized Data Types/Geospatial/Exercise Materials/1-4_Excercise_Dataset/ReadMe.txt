3. Data collected from May 2010 to August 2012


4. Geographic location of data collection (where was data collected?): 

	
	Tamarac National Wildlife Refuge, Minnesota, USA (TA; 47.0 N, -95.6 W)
	
	
5. Information about funding sources that supported the collection of the data:

American woodcock data collection was made possible through funding provided by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Webless Migratory Game Program through Research Work Order No. 91 at the U.S. Geological Survey Minnesota Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit with additional funding provided by Woodcock Minnesota, Inc. Federal and State permits for capture, banding, and radio-marking woodcock as part of the study by Daly (2014;http://hdl.handle.net/11299/167288) were granted by the U.S. Geological Survey Bird Banding Laboratory (Permit # 06258, Wayne Brininger, USFWS), and the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (Permit #s 17377 and 17973, W. Brininger, USFWS). Animal welfare and handling protocols in Daly’s (2014) study were approved by the University of Minnesota Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee under Protocol #1103A97333.

Golden-winged warbler data were collected as part of the study by Peterson (2014; http://hdl.handle.net/11299/167309) and Peterson et al. (2016) during a project funded by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and U.S. Geological Survey through Research Work Order No. 87 at the Minnesota Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit and Minnesota Department of Natural Resources following Protocol #1004A80575, approved by the University of Minnesota Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

-----------------------------------------
DATA-SPECIFIC INFORMATION FOR: ExtractedProductivity1m_1000m.zip
-----------------------------------------
Contains 5 .txt files of model-predicted productivity for American woodcock and golden-winged warblers at 5 spatial scales. Each file is for a different scale. All files include the scale in their name. For example, 1m_AWGW_Productivity_Comparison contains the ID of each sample (i.e., raster cell; "FID") and the associated model-predicted productivity of woodcock ("AW_fsp_1m") and warblers ("GW_fsp_1m"). For scales greater than 1 m, the productivity estimates are averages (see Kramer et al. in press A for further details). Column names are identical except the numbers change to reference the different spatial scales of each comparison. These model-derived predictions of productivity were extracted from the productivity rasters for both species (see below). 

-----------------------------------------
DATA-SPECIFIC INFORMATION FOR: StudyAreaCoverType_shapefile.zip
-----------------------------------------
Contains 1 shapefiles (.shp) and associated files and metadata (.prj, .cpg, .dbf, .sbx, .shx files) required for reading shapefiles into R or a GIS. 

study_area_cover_type.shp - Hand-digitized cover-type classification of study area at Tamarac NWR, Minnesota, USA. Digitization was based on 1-m resolution digital orthophoto quadrangles (2009; Minnesota Department of Natural Resources). Shapefile is in NAD 1983 UTM Zone 15N projected coordinate system. "GRIDCODE" values are as follows: 0 = non-nesting area, 1 = upland shrubland, 2 = grassland, 3 = wetland shrubland, 4 = mature forest, 5 = forested wetland. See Kramer et al. (in press A) for detailed description of cover-type classification.

Overview of files supporting .shp files (i.e., these files must be in the same folder as the .shp file when loading/viewing .shp file in a GIS):

.cpg files = an optional file that can be used to specify the code page for identifying the character set to be used.

.dbf files = the dBASE table that stores the index of the feature geometry

.prj files = the file that stores the coordinate system information

.shx files = file that stores the spatial index of the features

.sbx files = file that stores the spatial index of the features
