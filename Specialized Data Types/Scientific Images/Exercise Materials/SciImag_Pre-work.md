Prior to the workshop, please download the following software and
dataset on the computer you will be using during the workshop

- Software: [ImageJ](https://imagej.net/software/fiji/downloads) will be used to manipulate scientific images, specifically Fiji which is a distribution of ImageJ that includes additional useful plugins.

  - Windows users are recommended to install in the users directory where it will have permissions to update itself.

  - Mac users - the software may run through Rosetta if you have a newer M-series processor, this can have some performance cost. Alternatively you can download a [java-free version](https://forum.image.sc/t/fiji-clij-etc-native-on-apple-silicon-arm64-m1/53627/25) which can run natively

- Dataset for exercises: [Dataset for 'Multi‑Step Crystallization of Self‑Organized Spiral Eutectics'](https://doi.org/10.7302/day1-6d63)

  - Please download all the files of this dataset

- For transformation exercise: download the file [https://download.brainimagelibrary.org/39/26/39265b6e029f8af0/NC82_brain/C1-20201007_VT050279_DBD_28D07_AD_20x_GFP_brain_3_template.tif](https://download.brainimagelibrary.org/39/26/39265b6e029f8af0/NC82_brain/C1-20201007_VT050279_DBD_28D07_AD_20x_GFP_brain_3_template.tif)
