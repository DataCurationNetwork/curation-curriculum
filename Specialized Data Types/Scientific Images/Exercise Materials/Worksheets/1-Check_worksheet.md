# Check Worksheet for Scientific Images

## Check data files/images and read the documentation
- Review to ensure data is in scope for the repository
- Inventory the contents of the data files (e.g., open and sample the
files)
- Verify all metadata provided by the researcher; check available
documentation

## Key Ethical Considerations
- Review participant agreement and data use agreements; examine
potential impacts of sharing this data.
- Is it possible that the dataset may impact a specific group?
- Does this dataset follow compliance &amp; institutional policy?

## Essential Tasks

- Open the related article and supporting information if available
- Inventory the dataset
- Are you able to open files and/or determine which software to
use?
- Create working copy of files for formal inventory and testing
- Examine files for obvious errors/missing components/file
corruption


Example of corrupt image: <a

- Low resolution? Dpi? - is resolution high enough to interpret/be useful?
- Check that metadata quality is rich, accurate, and complete to
institutional requirements.
- Check documentation type- Readme / Codebook / Data Dictionary /
Other
- Check whether human subject data (data about humans regardless of IRB
determination) is present. If so,
- Request consent form / participation agreement if not present
- If the data are not de-identified, document for the "Request"
step.
- Check the accessibility of all files

- Ensure there are robust descriptions in plain text of data files and
images.
- Check whether any visualization(s) of data are easily accessible

- Review alt-text and visualization descriptions. Ensure these
describe, but do not interpret, associated visualizations.
- do they follow <a
href="https://webaim.org/articles/contrast/"><u>accessible color
contrast guidelines</u></a>; is color contrast sufficient?
