#Curator Log prompt for scientific images workshop

There are many examples of curator logs, including [this
one from Cornell University Library](https://github.com/DataCurationNetwork/curation-curriculum/blob/960b67d5afedc27baac8fba29268457be9d695a3/Specialized%20Data%20Types/Scientific%20Images/Exercise%20Materials/SciImag_Curation_Documentation_Template.txt).

Use it as a template, or create your own.

The curator log is used to record significant treatments or actions
applied to the dataset. This is for your own archival record keeping.

Key ethical considerations,

- Document that disclosure risk review has taken place. State if changes from original data have been made, but do not give enough detail on changes to reverse-engineer any anonymization.

- Include consent (or waiver) and/or IRB approval of sharing with administrative documentation. A good resource is the DCN [Curation of Data Collected by Informed Consent primer](https://github.com/DataCurationNetwork/data-primers/blob/master/Consent%20Forms%20Data%20Curation%20Primer/consent-forms-data-curation-primer.md).

Your curator log should include,

- Accessioning & deposit records (names, dates, contact information, submission agreements, etc.)

- Repository collection metadata

- Provenance logs (changes by curators in the Transform step)

- Service workflow for each step

- Correspondences and other interactions

- Preservation packaging, if any

- Any additional requirements at your institution
