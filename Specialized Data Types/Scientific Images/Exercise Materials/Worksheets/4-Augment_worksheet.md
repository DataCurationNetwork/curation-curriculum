# Augment Worksheet

##Augment the dataset

## Common AUGMENT steps include:

- Enhance metadata to best facilitate discoverability, such as by
ensuring datasets have a persistent identifier.
- Create and apply metadata for the data record, including descriptive
keywords
- When appropriate, structure and present metadata in domain-specific
schemas to facilitate interoperability with other systems
- Implement any other agreed-on enhancements to metadata or
documentation following discussion with researcher

## Key Ethical Considerations</strong>

- Make sure bibliographic information reflects correct author
attribution.
- Ensure any augmentation by the depositor to resolve ethical questions
from previous steps is completed.
- Double check all changes/augmentations with data depositor


## Essential Tasks

- Review information received from the researcher from initial deposit
and all subsequent conversations
- Update, as appropriate:
	- Metadata
	- Documentation (readme, Codebook, Data Dictionary, Other) for images and other files
	- Replacement files
	- Organization and Arrangement of files
	- Documentation of file organization, hierarchy, and naming convention(s)
- Facilitate discoverability:
	- Add links to related publications, grants, reports, source data, etc.
	- Provide additional description of files as appropriate for external indexing or other purposes.
	- Add subject terms
- Ensure keywords are sufficient and representative
- Provide suggestions to improve accessibility of content (e.g.,
alt-text or additional descriptions; color contrast; software version
and information; etc)
