#Evaluate Discussion Worksheet

For this wrap-up, you will evaluate this dataset according to the FAIR
and CARE principles.

1.  Review the final dataset, as currently visible and compare against
    > the FAIR principles. Is this dataset FAIR?

[<u>FAIR data</u>](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) are,

- Findable
- Accessible
- Interoperable
- Reusable

While the FAIR principles address the characteristics that facilitate
data sharing, there may be ethical issues that arise when working with
data that rightfully belong to other communities, and/or are collected
within or by those communities.

Consider the [<u>CARE Principles</u>](https://www.gida-global.org/care)
for Indigenous Data Governance,

- Collective Benefit
- Authority to Control
- Responsibility
- Ethics

2.  Can you think of examples where CARE principles might apply to scientific images?
