Hello XX,

Thank you for your submission to the Data Repository for the U of M
(DRUM). I am in the process of reviewing your submission, and I have a
few questions for you:

1\. The dataset would benefit from more documentation about the data
itself, how it was collected, etc. for future users. One of the
priorities of DRUM is the reusability of data without contacting the
author. We have found that a README can help provide necessary context
for reuse. I have attached a README that I have started to fill out for
you. Please help me fill out the rest. This will also help me understand
your data more and help with the rest of the curation process.

2\. RSC_rawplatereader_data_SO1059.xlsx appears to have duplicate
variables, an explanation in the README will help folks understand the
variables. Same with RSC_rawplatereader_data_SonAmutantsrelrates.xlsx

3\. The .raw files require a paid software to view (photoshop, etc.) Do
you know of any open source/freely available software that folks would
be able to use to open the .raw files? If not please share what software
you recommend, we should add that to the README documentation.

4\. It would be nice to group some of the files, what do you think about
us zipping up the files in folders for each figure?

5\. Please start thinking about a thumbnail you would like to use to
replace the "submission under curatorial review." You can share the
image with me via email when you return the completed README.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns. Thank you very
much for your submission, and I look forward to hearing from you.

Wanda

Hi Wanda,

I apologize for the slow response, I have been out for the past couple
weeks. I have addressed each of your points below. This raw data is all
associated with a published research article DOI: 10.1039/D3CB00093A.
This is the unmodified data collected from which analyses were
completed. I think most of these points would be cleared up by including
the DOI for the paper. It would be unlikely that people would be
accessing this data without first reading the paper. If they were
accessing the data without reading the paper, we would want them to read
the paper.

1\. The dataset would benefit from more documentation about the data
itself, how it was collected, etc. for future users. One of the
priorities of DRUM is the reusability of data without contacting the
author. We have found that a README can help provide necessary context
for reuse. I have attached a README that I have started to fill out for
you. Please help me fill out the rest. This will also help me understand
your data more and help with the rest of the curation process.

The methods section of the paper contains all relevant information as to
how data was collected.

2\. RSC_rawplatereader_data_SO1059.xlsx appears to have duplicate
variables, an explanation in the README will help folks understand the
variables. Same with RSC_rawplatereader_data_SonAmutantsrelrates.xlsx

Within the methods section of the paper, we note that data for each
variable was collected in triplicate.

3\. The .raw files require a paid software to view (photoshop, etc.) Do
you know of any open source/freely available software that folks would
be able to use to open the .raw files? If not please share what software
you recommend, we should add that to the README documentation.

This is also noted in the methods section. There is no open source
software. To view the raw MS files, we use Thermo Xcalibur 3.0.63 Qual
Browser

4\. It would be nice to group some of the files, what do you think about
us zipping up the files in folders for each figure?

This is fine.

5\. Please start thinking about a thumbnail you would like to use to
replace the "submission under curatorial review." You can share the
image with me via email when you return the completed README.

We will think about this.

Please let me know if there is anything else you need from me,

Thanks!

Dear XX,

Great news! Your submission to the Data Repository for U of M (DRUM) has
been curated and is now ready for your review at
https://hdl.handle.net/11299/XXX

There were a few significant changes that we made to your submission in
the curation process:

We've added a persistent link in the form of a DOI to your data:
[<u>https://doi.org/XX</u>](https://doi.org/XX)

This allows you and others to formally cite your data in bibliographies.
The DOI also exposes your data to online discovery tools like Google
Scholar and Web of Science Data Citation Index.

We added a thumbnail - if you have something you would prefer, please
share it and I will swap out the thumbnail

We cleaned up the record page Description

We added the manuscript full citation to the record page

We packaged the data following the Figure structure - to tidy up the
record page and help future re-users of the data with organization of
the files

We created and added a README to help with context of the data and help
with reuse, including a data tree of the files.

Please notify us in the next few days if you have any recommended
changes or corrections to the metadata record. We are happy to work with
you to fix any discrepancies. Meanwhile, your data is currently live and
viewable to the public and you should feel free to share the persistent
link with others and use our services, such as tracking your download
statistics.

We appreciate your contribution to DRUM
