# Worksheet for evaluating data quality: Simulation data

L. Wynholds, Marsolek, et al, 9/20/2023

The ‘CURATE(D)’ CHECK step revolves around inventorying and reviewing
the contents of the dataset and verifying that it is appropriate for the
repository. This often includes:

- Review to ensure data is in scope for the repository

- Inventory the contents of the data files (e.g., open and sample the
  files or code)

- Verify all metadata provided by the researcher; check available
  documentation

The data curator should read the readme.txt and associated metadata and
decide whether they provide enough information to answer the following
questions. If not, consideration should be made about having a
discussion with the researcher about whether the readme.txt or related
metadata needs additional information[^1].

Getting Started:

1)  Download the readme.txt file for the dataset

2)  Open the readme file

3)  Open the repository download page for the dataset

4)  See if you can answer the following questions for the dataset (see
    checklist on following page)

	a. Actual metadata may vary depending on the specific dataset and type

## Metadata Checklist:
Data Type 
a. What is the data type, format, size, and number of
files?
b. Whether the dataset is a subset, part, or related to other
datasets
c. Does the data description include the level of aggregation,
de-identification, processing, or cleaning that was done in the
data?
d. Does the metadata include the source(s) of any secondary data or
previously collected data used in the production of the dataset (e.g.
inputs, calibration, reference datasets, ground truthing datasets,
etc)
e. Metadata available that describes the above adequately for others
to use (e.g. readme.txt)


Related Tools, Software, Code, and Publications

a. State whether specialized tools are needed

b. State which code versions and which OS were used to produce the data  

c. State how to access the code/software/tools (e.g. citation to code or download website)

d. State whether the dataset was used in articles or other
publications, and if so, citations to published or in-process
title/author/journal

e. Reference code group mat’ls (link)

Data Standards 
Are there data standards used in the dataset? If so,
which ones and where are they specified? (cite which standard)

a. Metadata schemas
b. Standard terminologies/controlled vocabularies
c. Content/encoding standards
d. Common data elements
e. Identifiers (PIDs)


Data Access 
a. Is the DOI and/or other PID listed in the metadata?
b. Are there any legal, technical or ethical considerations with sharing the data?
c. Did the funders require that the data be made accessible to the
public? If so is that information provided to the end users with
consideration for future use?
d. Did the funders require that the data be available for a set period?
If so, how long/what dates?

Data Restrictions 

a. Are there limitations to use? (e.g. IP
restrictions, embargoes, requires human subject IRB review for use,
etc)
b. Are there instructions for gaining access to restricted
datasets?
c. Embargo period?
d. Other access controls?

Data Stewardship and Data Provenance
a. Who was responsible for producing/QC for the
data?
b. Who can be contacted with questions regarding the
data? (usually the first author unless otherwise specified)
c. Funding acknowledgements – Who funded the research, what is the grant
number? If there is a compliance requirement for open access, does the
metadata specify who is responsible for ensuring that the data is
available once deposited? (e.g. the archive, the researcher, or the
funding body)
d. Are all the authors, funders and other contributors acknowledged in
the metadata?
e. re there any license agreement requirements or IP restrictions that
downstream users should know about?
